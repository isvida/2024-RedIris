# LLM opensource

This repository will show how to build an IA assistant using **Large Language Models** (`LLM`) open source.

## Ollama

Ollama is an open-source tool that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your own machine. It provides seamless integration with various models, such as Llama 3, Mistral, and Gemma. You can interact with these models through a CLI (Command Line Interface) or via an API

### Installation

It could be installed using several ways, but this tutorial will use a `Docker` image, being easy to running or update the installation. Follow this link [ollama](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama) to install. Once the `Docker`is configured in the computer `ollama` can be deployed using:


#### CPU only ####

```shell
$ docker run -d -v ollama:${HOME}/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

#### GPU ####

```shell
$ docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:${HOME}/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

### Run models locally###

```shell
$ docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama3
```

#### Try different models #####

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** is an AI framework that enhances the quality of responses generated by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT. It achieves this by grounding the model on **external sources of knowledge**, supplementing the LLM's internal representation of information. Essentially, RAG combines the power of generative AI with factual information retrieved from authoritative sources, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant answers¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥. üåü
